Run
---

+ clone this repository
+ clone the digits repo somewhere else (ideally on the same level so symlinks work)
+ install and run jupyter

Example:

```
cd some/where/
git clone https://github.com/eegdigits/digits.git
git clone https://github.com/eegdigits/notebooks.git
cd notebooks
pip3 install jupyter --user
jupyter notebook
```

A browser window should pop up listing all notebooks.

Unfortunately the dataset is not public, contact me for more info if you are interested.
